So that I can explore the plateau,
I would like to turn the rover

User Story 4

As a rover driver,
So that I can explore the plateau,
I would like to move the rover in the direction it is facing

User Story 5

As a rover driver,
So that I can explore the plateau,
I would like to give the rover multiple directions to guide it's movement

User Story 6
